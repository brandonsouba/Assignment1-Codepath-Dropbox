# Week 1 [codepath iOS for Designers]

1. How many hours did it take to complete?
10-12 hours
	
2. Which required and optional stories have you completed?
All required and 2 stories. The correct optionals are in the GIF, but the included code is from before my project became corrupted, so it only contains 2 optionals.
